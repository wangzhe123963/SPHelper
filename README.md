# SPHelper
This is the Sharepoint helper class that I have been using for over a decade. It is completely self typed and can help you get rid of the pain of piecing together CAML statements every time you query a list. With just a few simple lines of code, you can handle operations such as adding, deleting, modifying, and querying.
